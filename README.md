Calvin Dating App (team b): Bryce Allen, Brian Goins, Bryan Fowler, Joshua Bussis, Charlie Newton.

As a team we wanted to tackle a complex but realistic application. We strived to 
look for something that would not only just fulfill class requirements but give 
us an opportunity to learn and a real push to develop in a cross platform
development environment. We wanted a tangible product that would actually be 
downloaded and possibly used by fellow students. 

This vision lead to the idea of a Calvin dating app. With incorporating a 
Christian thought perspective, we believe that we can build and create an 
application that will be applicable to our peers. And while most dating apps are 
rather just a "Fad" instead of a "Trend" this works in our favor as we do not 
expect to focus on the maintenance portion of the product, as that comes after this 
course.
